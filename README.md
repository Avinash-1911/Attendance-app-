# 🎯 Face‑Track

An attendance app for faculty that performs face‑based identification of students and logs attendance to an Excel file. 👩‍🏫📄

---

## 🧭 Overview
Face‑Track is a desktop application for classroom use at VIT Bhopal University that streamlines attendance with live face scanning and automatic record keeping. It uses a FaceNet embedding model for recognition, tracks sessions, and writes results to a structured Excel sheet for easy export and auditing. 🎥🧠📈

## ✨ Features
- 🔍 Real‑time face detection and recognition using a FaceNet‑based pipeline
- 🕹️ One‑click session start/stop with automatic Excel attendance logs
- 📦 Offline‑first: the model downloads once and is cached locally
- 🧑‍🏫 Simple UI designed for live classroom use

---

## 🛠️ Tech stack
- MATLAB App Designer (app: `AttendanceApp.mlapp`)
- MATLAB Computer Vision Toolbox & Deep Learning Toolbox (runtime)
- FaceNet model weights as `.mat` (fetched on first run)
- Windows installer built with MATLAB Compiler (`.exe`)

---

## 🗂️ Folder structure
- `AttendanceApp.mlapp` — main MATLAB App Designer application
- `faceNet_model.mat` — FaceNet embedding model (downloaded if missing)
- `faceNet_new/` — helper scripts, utilities, and model handling
- `facetrack.mp4` — demo video of the app
- `MyAppInstaller.exe` — Windows installer
- `README.md` — this documentation

## 🔄 How it works
1. 🎥 Start a session to capture the webcam feed  
2. 🧬 Generate FaceNet embeddings for each detected face  
3. ✅ Mark present when similarity exceeds the threshold  
4. 📁 On session end, save an Excel file with time, class metadata, and recognized IDs

2. Run the installer with default options
3. Launch Face‑Track
4. Allow the automatic model download to complete
5. Restart the app
6. Start a new attendance session

## 🙋 How to use

### 1) Create a faculty account
- click “New User”  
- Enter id and a secure password; an internal Account ID is generated  
- Account ID and password are stored locally in a separate Excel sheet for reference and offline sign‑in

### 2) Create slots
- Open “Slots” and click “New Slot”  
- Provide slot name (e.g., “CSE101‑A”)
- Save the slot; it appears in the slot list

### 3) Select a slot for attendance
- From the dashboard, choose the active slot from the dropdown  
- The selection sets the context for enrollment and attendance saving

### 4) Register students in a slot
- Open “Add Students” for the selected slot  
- For each student, enter Name and Registration Number  
- Click “Capture Face” to register the Face ID; ensure a clear, frontal view under good lighting  
- Save the record; repeat for all students in the slot

### 5) Take attendance
- With the desired slot selected, click “Take Attendance”  
- Ask students to come one by one in front of the camera  
- Each recognized student is marked Present automatically and appended to the current session log  
- Click “Stop” to finish; the Excel file for the session is generated in the output folder

Tips:
- Maintain consistent lighting; avoid strong backlight or occlusions  
- If a face isn’t recognized, recapture the student’s Face ID from the Register screen and retry

## 📊 Excel output
- New workbook per session (or appended sheet, depending on settings)  
- Typical columns: `Timestamp`, `Student ID/Name`, `Status (Present)`, `latitude`, `longitude`
